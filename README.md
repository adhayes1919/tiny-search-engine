# Tiny Search Engine

This Tiny Search Engine was developed as part of Dartmouth's CS50 course. The project is divided into three key components:

## 📌 Components

1. **Crawler**: Crawls through a website, retrieves webpages up to a given depth, and extracts embedded URLs.
2. **Indexer**: Builds an inverted index from the crawler directory, mapping words to document IDs and counts.
3. **Querier**: Returns relevant webpages based on user queries, supporting logical operators (`AND` and `OR`).

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

To compile the project, run:

```bash
make
```

To test the project, execute:

```bash
make test
```

To clean up compiled files, use:

```bash
make clean
```

## 📌 Additional Information

- Please see individual directories for **implementation specifications** and further details.
- Due to academic integrity policies, the source code is **not publicly available on GitHub** since the project is still actively used in coursework.
